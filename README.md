# WDI-UXDI-PMI Collaboration

In the real world, product managers, UX designers and developers will not be working in isolation. This project is an opportunity for GA DC immersive students to work together and see what it's like to be part of a real world, multi-disciplined team.

For this collaboration, UX designers and web developers from the last UXDI and WDI classes will have the opportunity to work with and build out a PMI student's prototype. By the end of the collaboration, each team is expected to ship a product.

> **IMPORTANT:** By signing up for this project you are making a serious commitment. You cannot bow out from the project once it has begun.

## What?

Groups are expected to ship a completed product by the end of the project. The project should be a responsive web application. It should **NOT** be a mobile application.
